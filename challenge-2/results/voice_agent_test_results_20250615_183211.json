        "Agent: Hello, This is Sarah calling from Riverline Bank regarding your credit card bill. \nMay i speak with Rajesh Kumar?\n",
        "Customer: Oh, hello Sarah. Yes, this is Rajesh Kumar. I was just about to call you, actually.\n",
        "Agent: Hello, Rajesh Kumar. I'm calling to remind you that your credit card bill of \u20b938,209.92 is currently 53 days overdue. Are you able to make the payment today?\n",
        "Customer: Oh, hello Sarah. Yes, I'm aware of the overdue bill. Unfortunately, I recently lost my job, so paying the full amount right now is a bit difficult.\n",
        "Agent: I completely understand your concern, Rajesh Kumar, especially given the recent job loss. I know this is a challenging situation. Let me see what options we have available to help you.\n\nWould you prefer to pay 50% of the amount now, and the remaining 50% in 7 days, or would a full payment in 5 days work better for you? We can also discuss a potential payment plan if needed.\n",
        "Customer: Oh, Sarah, that's very kind of you to offer some options. Honestly, both of those sound a bit tough right now, with my income situation being what it is.\n",
        "Agent: I completely understand your concern about both options being challenging, Rajesh Kumar, especially given your current income situation. I can certainly understand that. Let me see what else we can do.\n\nGiven your circumstances, we can explore a few avenues. We could set up a payment plan for the next few months, allowing you to make smaller, more manageable payments. Alternatively, we could offer a further extended deadline, perhaps a full payment within 10 days, to give you a little more time to get things sorted. Can I have your confirmation that a 10-day extension would work for you?\n",
        "Customer: Oh, Sarah, a payment plan over a few months sounds a bit more manageable, given everything. I'd really appreciate that if it's possible.\n",
        "Agent: Absolutely, Rajesh Kumar, I can help you with that. I understand. A payment plan over a few months sounds like a good option for you.\n\nLet's set up a payment plan. We can break down the total amount due into equal installments over, say, the next three months. This would allow you to make more manageable payments. Would that work for you?\n\nTo confirm, the total amount due is \u20b938,209.92. If we divide that into three monthly payments, it would be approximately \u20b912,736.64 per month, payable on the same date each month, beginning a month from today.\n\nCan I have your confirmation that this payment plan suits your current situation?\n",
        "Customer: Oh, yes, Sarah, that sounds much better, thank you. Three monthly payments of that amount would be manageable, considering my circumstances. I confirm that the plan suits me.\n",
        "Agent: Hello, Rajesh Kumar. I'm so glad we could find a solution that works for you.\n\nFantastic! I'm happy to hear that the payment plan sounds manageable. So, to confirm, we'll set up the payment plan with three monthly installments of approximately \u20b912,736.64 each, starting a month from today, on the same date each month. Is that correct?\n\nGreat. I will send you a confirmation SMS with all the details of the payment plan shortly. I'll also call you on the same date in one month to confirm the first payment was processed.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation, Rajesh Kumar. I truly appreciate it. Have a great day!\n"
